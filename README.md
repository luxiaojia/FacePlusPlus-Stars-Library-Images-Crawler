## How to use
[**Deprecated** 09/29/2018] The Face++ CDN image source is gone now so this script cannot work as expected anymore ☹️ There are still a lot of saved star images under `/assets` directory 👻.

    - it works fine on Mac OX 10.9 with Python 2.x(my environment)
    - Win/Linux should also work
    - add you star list to stars.txt
    - one star for one line
    
    pyhon getStarsPhotos.py
    
    - wait for minutes or just watch the console to know the progress
